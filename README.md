# Ore Tweaker Config

This repo configures [Ore Tweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ore-tweaker) for a Minecraft modpack I'm making.

The objective of the modpack is to rebalance the game, de-emphasizing trading and automatic farming, and emphasizing exploration, building, and mining.

This Ore Tweaker config contributes to that objective in the following ways:

- Makes iron more abundant above sea level.
  - There's now more of an incentive to mine horizontally into mountains instead of just going straight down to bedrock.
  - A higher iron spawn rate is needed because the modpack disables iron golem drops.
- Concentrates gold in a few biomes, making exploration more important.
  - Gold is abundant in badlands, deserts, and rivers.
  - Elsewhere, gold spawns at 50% the usual rate.
- Makes diamonds more abundant.
  - Since the introduction of deepslate and the changes to ore generation in 1.18, mining for diamonds has gotten harder. This made trading for diamond tools/armor overpowered by comparison.
  - This change should make it viable to craft your own diamond gear.
- Makes all ores more abundant in caves.
  - This makes caving more lucrative, and gives players more of an incentive to explore dangerous areas.
